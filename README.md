# Text classification

## Where to get the dataset and word embeddings?
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/cfpb/us-consumer-finance-complaints
* Pretrained word embeddings: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

## Future work
Some ideas that can further improve the model:
* Increase the size of the data
* Add more memory units to the layers and/or more layers.
* Increase the number of epochs
